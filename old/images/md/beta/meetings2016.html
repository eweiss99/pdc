Gloria will show a video from her liveaboard off Socorro.  Diving around Socorro is usually done on a liveaboard and has been called the Mexican Gallapagos (of course Cocos Islands have been called the Gallapagos of Central America, and there is only one group of islands known as the Gallapagos).  But Socorro is closer to Washington than the real Gallapagos, so come find out how close Socorro is to the real thing.
