  <h3>Wednesday, August 13, 2014</h3>YES, WE'RE MEETING ON THE SECOND WEDNESDAY! We will have a special presentation form Amir Fogel.<p>
  Amir Fogel is a graduate of Hampshire College in Amherst, MA. There he studied marine biology, with a focus in shark behavior and conservation, and documentary film. Amir has spent time volunteering in the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve near Tulum, Mexico as well as a volunteer diver at the Maritime Aquarium of Norwalk in CT. In addition, he is a PADI certified Dive Master and has just returned from working at a dive shop in Zihuatanejo, Mexico.  His documentary, Niche, explores the many intricacies of current shark conservation measures. The film is a compilation of personal footage, stock footage, and interviews with professionals from many backgrounds. Niche is intended to first establish the importance of sharks to the survival of marine ecosystems, followed by a unique glance into the complexities of the challenges in current shark conservation measures. What sets, Niche, apart from other shark conservation films is the representation of diverse perspectives. Bringing the voices of commercial fishermen, scientists, and conservationists all to the table, in order to discuss the future of shark conservation.

Ed was a professional photographer in the West Palm Beach area.
