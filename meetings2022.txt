<p>Following club business, Andrew will show pictures and describe his 2021 dive on the <em>Lusitania</em>! The British liner was sunk by a German U-boat on May 7, 1915 about 11 miles off the cost of Ireland with the loss of more than 1100 lives. There is a continuing controversy whether or not the Lusitania was carrying arms to Great Britian, which would have made it a fair target. Today, it rests in 305 feet of water.</p>
