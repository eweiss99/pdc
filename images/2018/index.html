Patowmack Divers arranges several dive trips per year to locations off Virginia and Maryland seashores, Outer Banks, NC, and other great dive sites in the United States, the Caribbean, and beyond. Group purchasing power allows us to enjoy discounts on charters, rentals, and accommodations. We are also active in preservation, research, and environmental protection. We take full advantage of the aquatic expertise in the DC metro area for speakers at our meetings, including such diverse topics as Underwater Archeology, Reef Ecology, Treasure Hunting Expeditions, and Aquarium setup and operations. </p>
