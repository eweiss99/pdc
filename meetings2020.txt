<h6>Wednesday, November 4</h6>
Ben Scheelk with the Ocean Foundation will talk and show pictures of their Sea Grass Grow program. The SeaGrass Grow campaign is a carbon offset program that allows people to purchase carbon offset credits that funds seagrass planting. Seagrass habitats are up to 45 times more effective than the most pristine Amazonian rainforest in their carbon uptake abilities and provide protection and shelter to ocean habitat. For every $1 invested in coastal restoration projects, $15 in net economic benefits is created. By utilizing this unique carbon offset program, The Ocean Foundation has been able to combat ocean acidification, a result of carbon produced climate change, as well as help restore ocean habitat, and support the local communities that depend on ocean health.

<h6>Wednesday, October 7</h6>
<p>Club business will start at 7:30, afterwards Marc will present "Life Aboard the Titanic” Once heralded as the grand, unsinkable ocean liner of the sea in 1912, 
            the RMS Titanic sailed into legend after striking an iceberg and disappearing into oblivion, more than two miles on the ocean floor. Seventy-three years later, 
            scientists discovered the dead wreck only to uncover a hidden ecosystem of sea life, from finless fish to wood-boring organisms. Board the RMS Titanic once 
            again to discover the unique lifeforms that have inhabited the legendary ocean liner for more than century. </p>
