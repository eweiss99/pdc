			<h2>Who We Are</h2>
			<p>Patowmack Divers is a social group of people with a common interest: SCUBA DIVING!! Our members are male and female, from 20s to mid 60s, and from all walks of life. Our diving experience ranges from recently certified to old salts; from warm water photographers, to deep wreck technical divers, and cave divers.</p>
			<h2>Meetings</h2>
			<h3>Wednesday,  April 4</h3>

<p>We will not meet on April 4.  Our meeting will be combined with the Pasta Pigout -- that "lowest form of dinner party" with great food, lots of great company, great supply of wine, and a great time--on Saturday, April 14 at 6 pm.  Contact the club for details.  We will have our regular meeting on Wednesday, May 2 when Dr Lita Proctor discusses her research on the role of microbes in the marine environment.  June, July, and August programs will be announced soon.

			<p>From the day it was realized that the U.S.S. Cyclops would never arrive at her destination, much attention has been drawn to the subject of this colossal collier. Many have been curious because of the mystery surrounding her disappearance in the area known as the Bermuda Triangle. Others are interested in naval history and some because of a family connection to a member of her crew. For more details click <a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/vzez3ezf/">here</a>

Our best meetings are when we go diving with Patowmack Divers guests.</p>
			<h2>What We Do</h2>
			<p>Patowmack Divers arranges several dive trips per year to locations off Virginia and Maryland seashores, Outer Banks, NC, and other great dive sites in the United States, the Caribbean, and beyond. We also schedule local tune-up dives in local pools and quarries. Group purchasing power allows us to enjoy discounts on charters, rentals, and accommodations. We are also active in preservation, research, and environmental protection. We take full advantage of the aquatic expertise in the DC metro area for speakers at our meetings, including such diverse topics as Underwater Archeology, Reef Ecology, Treasure Hunting Expeditions, and Aquarium setup and operations. </p>
			<p>We also have an annual Pasta Pigout to enjoy fresh pasta, good sauce, good wine, and good conversation.</p>

		<h2>Where We Dive</h2>
		<p>The short answer is anywhere.  Club dive trips can be two divers or a dozen.  Our recent dive trips include local quarries, West Palm Beach, Cozumel, Puerto Rico, Belize, St. Vincent, Palau, Sidapan, the Philipines, and Indonesia.</p>
