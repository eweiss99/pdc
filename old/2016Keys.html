		<h1 class="w3-text-shadow w3-center"> Diving and Snorkling the Keys </h1>
		<h3 class="w3-center"> March 17, 2009 </h3>



<p>Inia, Paul, Larry and Eric dove the Floriday Keys from May 15 to May 21.  Inia flew down a day early, but the rest of us flew down on Sunday.  

<p>Monday we dove 

<p>Tuesday we dove

<p>Wednesday we dove

<p>Thursday Larry and Paul did two dives on the Vandenberg off of Key West.  Eric and Inia decided that the stormy weather and rough seas were more than they wanted to deal with.  Eric wandered around Key West hitting Heminway's old hangout (Sloppy Joe's), the Mel Fischer Maritime Museum, and the Audubon House (where Audubon never visited).  Sloppy Joe's is better for beer than food.

<p>Friday we took a ferry, the Yankee Freedom, out to Garden Key and Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas, 70 miles west of Key West.  The Frerry is a catamaran and took about 2:15 in each direction.  We took a tour of the fort and appreciated the hardships that the prisioners (including Dr. Mudd) endured.  The only natural water in the Dry Tortugas is rainwater, and there isn't much of that. Everything has to be hauled After lunch (included in the ticket) we snorkled.  I have done a lot more diving than snorkling, but the snorkling was fun.  I have snorkled in my wetsuit, but found that my natural boyancy was enough that I didn't need anything more.  It was a challenge to identify the fish (parrotfish, etc.) because they appeared paler and we viewed them from the top.

<p>Larry, Paul, and Eric flew back direct from Key West to National Airport.  Inia spent a few more days in the Keys.
