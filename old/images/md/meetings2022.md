###### **Monday, January 3, 2022**\--Virtual Happy Hour at 7:00 pm, Virtual Meeting at 7:30 pm

Following club business, Andrew will show pictures and describe his 2021
dive on the *Lusitania*! The British liner was sunk by a German U-boat
on May 7, 1915 about 11 miles off the cost of Ireland with the loss of
more than 1100 lives. There is a continuing controversy whether or not
the Lusitania was carrying arms to Great Britian, which would have made
it a fair target. Today, it rests in 305 feet of water.
