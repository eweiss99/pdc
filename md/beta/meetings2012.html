We will not meet on April 4.  Our meeting will be combined with the Pasta Pigout -- that "lowest form of dinner party" with great food, lots of great company, great supply of wine, and a great time--on Saturday, April 14 at 6 pm.  Contact the club for details.  We will have our regular meeting on Wednesday, May 2 when Dr Lita Proctor discusses her research on the role of microbes in the marine environment.  June, July, and August programs will be announced soon.
