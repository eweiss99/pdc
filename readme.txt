I set this web site up using txt files that are really html. I wanted to use markdown, but going from html to markdown on the old files meant that going from markdown to html added section tags that centered everything.

top.html and bottom.html are the top and bottom of each web page. The other txt files have the body that changes. Use ./txt.sh to put them together outputting a file ending in html.

./txt.sh index

for example 

ls -1 *.txt gets a list of all txt files
