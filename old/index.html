<h3 class="text-center mt-5">Welcome to Patowmack Divers</h3>
<p> Patowmack Divers is a social group of people with a common interest: SCUBA DIVING!! Our members are male and female, from 20s to mid 70s. Our diving experience ranges from recently certified to retired instructors from warm water photographers, to deep wreck technical divers, and cave divers.  </p>
<p> Patowmack Divers arranges several dive trips per year to locations off Virginia and Maryland seashores, Outer Banks, NC, and other great dive sites in the United States, the Caribbean, and beyond. Group purchasing power allows us to enjoy discounts on charters, rentals, and accommodations. We are also active in preservation, research, and environmental protection. We take full advantage of the aquatic expertise in the DC metro area for speakers at our meetings, including such diverse topics as Underwater Archeology, Reef Ecology, Treasure Hunting Expeditions, and Aquarium setup and operations.  </p>
<p>We also have an annual Pasta Pigout to enjoy fresh pasta, good sauce, good wine, and good conversation.</p>

<p> The short answer is anywhere. Club dive trips can be two divers or a dozen. Our recent dive trips include local quarries, West Palm Beach, Cozumel, Puerto Rico, Belize, St. Vincent, Palau, Sidapan, the Philipines, and Indonesia.  </p>
